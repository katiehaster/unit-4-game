# Fancy Pets

This game allows users to interact with what they see on the page to play a simple game, kind of like an interactive game of "Memory."
The user will see a "Random Number" generated on the left side. Each fancy pet is randomly assigned a number. Click the pet portraits to reach the random number EXACTLY. Don't go over, don't go under!
