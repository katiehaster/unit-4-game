# unit-4-game

To get in the hang of README's I'm going to do this:

What the project does:

This game allows users to interact with what they see on the page to play a simple game, kind of like an interactive game of "Memory."

Why the project is useful:

It was more useful to me as a learning tool than it would be to anone who plays it.

How users can get started with the project:

Begin to play by clicking on a portrait!
